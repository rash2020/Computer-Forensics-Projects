## Description

These projects are practical experiments conducted on the DeterLab platform, a collaborative effort developed by multiple universities to share and execute various cybersecurity labs. The experiments involve forensic analysis of compromised systems, simulating real-world scenarios. Each project follows a structured approach as outlined in the DeterLab documentation, and the results are compiled into comprehensive forensic reports. 

For more information on how to set up and use DeterLab, refer to the following resources:
